Lightweight curses/Motif spreadsheet based on GNU oleo

(Ne)Oleo is a light-weight spreadsheet that will work in almost any environment.
Oleo was an official GNU spreadsheet that had not been updated since 2000. It 
suffered from considerable bitrot. Neoleo is an update to Oleo that fixes these 
issues.



If you are downloading the file from github, most people, especially
distro packagers wanting to do typical configure && make && make install
should download the file neoleo-X.Y.Z.tar.gz, rather than the
source files.

Quick start
-----------

Create ~/.oleorc with the following line:
set-default-format general.float

Documents and examples
----------------------

Neoleo installs examples and html documentation in a shared directory.
The location of this directory is dependent on the `prefix' option
supplied during the package configuration. It defaults to 
`/usr/local/share/oleo'. To determine the actual location, type:
	neoleo --version
The line prefixed with `Datadir:' will give you the required information.

You should explore that directory to see what is available.

Features
--------
	* ncurses interface: neoleo -x , or neoleo -nw
	* Macro language
	    (still a bit untidy in places, but it works)
	* Charts generated from spreadsheet data
	    (interface is not yet stable, but the capability is in there)
	* Sizeable library of expressions
	    (doesn't currently include statistical regressions)
	* File format conversions
	    (support of this is still pretty primitive; don't plan
	    on importing E*cel files anytime soon)



Disabled features
-----------------

Code still exists, but is currently not compiled for:
	* GNU Gettext 0.10.32
	* GNU texinfo (3.12) to build the documentation
	* SciPlot  for charts
	* GNU plotutils for charts
	* XmHTML for still-incomplete online documentation


Motif
-----

The Motif front-end is disabled by default. To configure using Motif:
	configure --with-motif
This front-end requires that the XBae library and header files are
installed.


Compiling from GIT
------------------

    1.  Run the following command:

        autoreconf -iv

    2.  configure as normal

may have some bearing on users, so they may be advised to read them.
