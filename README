Lightweight curses/Motif spreadsheet based on GNU oleo

(Ne)Oleo is a light-weight spreadsheet that will work in almost any environment.
Oleo was an official GNU spreadsheet that had not been updated since 2000. It 
suffered from considerable bitrot. Neoleo is an update to Oleo that fixes these 
issues.



If you are downloading the file from github, most people, especially
distro packagers wanting to do typical configure && make && make install
should download the file neoleo-X.Y.Z.tar.gz, rather than the
source files.


Features
--------
	* ncurses interface: neoleo -x , or neoleo -nw
	* Motif+Xbae interface: neoleo
	* Macro language
	    (still a bit untidy in places, but it works)
	* Charts generated from spreadsheet data
	    (interface is not yet stable, but the capability is in there)
	* Sizeable library of expressions
	    (doesn't currently include statistical regressions)
	* File format conversions
	    (support of this is still pretty primitive; don't plan
	    on importing E*cel files anytime soon)
	* Tcl extension (see below)



Disabled features
-----------------


Formerly, the default was to build with ncurses+Motif+Xbae, downgradeable
to:
	* curses-only using: ./configure --without-x
	* curses+X11  using: ./configure --without-motif
To keep things simple, ncurses+Motif+Xbae is now built. This means that
the Xbae library must be installed.


Code still exists, but is currently not compiled for:
	* GNU Gettext 0.10.32
	* GNU texinfo (3.12) to build the documentation
	* SciPlot  for charts
	* GNU plotutils for charts
	* XmHTML for still-incomplete online documentation


Compiling from GIT
------------------

    1.  Run the following command:

        autoreconf -iv

    2.  configure as normal


Tcl extension
-------------

Neoleo is now available as a shared library, making it callable from Tcl.

Support is very limited and flakey at the moment, but you can do some
cool things like this:
$ rlwrap tclsh
% load neoleo.so
% start)swig_motif
Open up the test.oleo spreadsheet manually
% get_formula 2 2 ; # this gives you the formula at cell R2C2
r[-1]c + rc[-1]

Pretty cool, huh?
