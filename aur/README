Packaging directory for Arch Linux

It's really here only for my (mcarter) benefit. If someone takes over the packaging then they may also find it useful. Otherwise, you can just ignore it.

When you think everything is fine :

1. At top level:
	make dist && make distcheck
   Ensure everything runs smoothly
BETTER: python2 makeit.py

2. Run
	mksetup
   to create the build directories: `test' and `release'

3. Check that it will build in principle:
	cd test ; makepkg

4. Once you are happy that it passes, tag, commit and upload the release to github

5. Check that it builds from github:
	cd release ; makepkg

6. `cd release ; makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO ; git commit -a ; git push' to release into AUR
