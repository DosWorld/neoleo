Packaging directory for Arch Linux

It's really here only for my (mcarter) benefit. If someone takes over the packaging then they may also find it useful. Otherwise, you can just ignore it.

# PREREQUISITES

pip3 install gitpython # http://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html
pip3 install PyGithub 

# PROCEDURE

When you think everything is fine :

1. Build archive, and check it:
	./makeit.py -1

2. Create the build directories (`release' and `test'):
	./makeit.py -2

3. Check that it will build in principle:
	cd test ; makepkg

4. Once you are happy that it passes, tag, commit and upload the release to github

5. Check that it builds from github:
	cd release ; makepkg

6. `cd release ; makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO ; git commit -a ; git push' to release into AUR
