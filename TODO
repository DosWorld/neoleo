* Multiple Document Interface
	(done) implement framework for putting global variables into so they're
		no longer global and we can allocate them on a per-window or
		per file basis
	(todo) complete the above for all global variables
	(todo) hook this in to Motif interface
	(todo) hook this to curses based interface

* Sorting
	(todo) implement an interface that'll allow us to call external
		sorting and such
	(todo) replace our own sorting function by the standard one using
		the interface described above

* Regions
	(todo) Use Mark and Current Cell to define a region and
		get region commands to work on this.

* Move vs. Copy
	(todo) Region copy as well as move changes relative coordinates
		in formulas. For move operations this should probably
		not happen.

* Add "date" and "time" formats, allow them to be input and allow
  for arithmetic with them.
	(done) Clean up cell.h's junk.
	(done) Add FMT_DATE
	(done) check file I/O stuff against new date format
	(todo) document FMT_DATE, the various date representations
	(todo) allow for date input

* Integrate GSL (Gnu Scientific Library).
	(todo) integrate it
  The GSL is a collection of routines for numerical analysis,
  which we happen to be lacking in Oleo.

* Import/Export Filters.
 - SYLK
	(done) don't flunk out on reading Excel files
	(todo) translate SYLK options into Oleo options
	(done) translate SYLK functions into Oleo functions (SUM -> sum)
	(todo) add all known functions to the function tranlation table
	(done) interpret SYLK ranges right
		SYLK says RC[-2]:RC[-1], Oleo says rc[-2:-1]
	(todo) interpret boundaries
	(todo) interpret fill patterns
	(todo) ...
	(todo) make this list more complete

 - CSV would be nice (DB 17/3/1999: LIST format can do this,
	now also recognizes CSV file name suffix)
 - Fixed width.

* Figure out why having kinput2 present kills oleo.

* Build a graph to figure out in which order to recalculate, then
  also use it to speed up recalculation.
  In the process, make sure we update a cell a determinable number of
  times (1 for instance) per recalculation.
	(todo) build graph
	(todo) use graph in recalculation
	(todo) examples/loop.oleo : cell A3 increases with 123, not 1,
		at every recalculation.




Longer term or obsolete TODO's :

* Fix sort routines

# Figure out why sort.c requires functions passed as args to a function
