UBUNTU 16.10 + NEOLEO 4.0.1
===========================

The following packages should be installed:
libxbae-dev
swig
tcl-dev

tcl.h is stored /usr/include/tcl/tcl.h, rather than as /usr/include/tcl.h

./configure CFLAGS="-I/usr/include/tcl"

Running:
$neoleo
(warning) Font 8x13 could not be loaded.
neoleo 2.0:Default font 8x13 could not be loaded.

It bails out. neoleo -x works, though.

Try rebuilding fonts:
sudo fc-cache -f -v
Didn't work


Try adding package xbae, libxbae4m
Still no success.

For some bizarre reason, the following actually works:
$ tclsh
% load libneoleo.so
% start_swig_motif
