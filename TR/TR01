TR01: Formatting of cell values.

Neoleo has some formatting oddities whereby values entered as,
for example, 16.36, come out as 16.369999999999999 in both
the editor and the region and the cells.

A recent commit (on 24-Dec-2016) fixed this issue, "to a large extent". 
The editor
now appears right, but not necessarily the cells themselves. To
fix this issue, it is recommended that users set the default format
to `general.float'.

This is achieved by issuing the command:
M-a f general.float

Dev notes
---------

This problem arises due to the fact that neoleo converts strings ("16.36")
to imprecise doubles. When they are printed, the accuracy of the numbers
was reproduced to 15 decimal places, which unfortunately consisted of
...999 .

To circumvent this, io-utils.c:pr_flt() tries to bump the input value
to just above the 999 threshold. I suspect that for certain large values
this might not work, due to the precision with which doubles are stored.

In the cells themselves, pr_flt() is only called when the format is 
general.float, which is why it is best to set this as the default
format. Users can still over-ride the default on a cell or range basis.
