TR04: atlast Forth subsystem

FILES OVERVIEW
--------------

Copied over from John Walker's tarball:
* doc/atlast2.html
* src/atlast.c
* src/atlast.h - see below
* src/atldef.h

New files which implement oleo-specific functionality:
* src/atoleo.c
* src/atoleo.h

Existing files which have been modified:
* src/basic.c - wrote forth() function
* src/basic.h - added forth(0 signature
* src/cmd.h   - extern "C" wrapper added
* src/defun.h - DEFUN forth
* src/main.cc - added init_atoleo() to main()

ATLAST.H
--------

Extern "C" wrappers were placed in the header file to make it 
compatable with both C and C++.

John Walker's Makefile defined some compilation macros. In order not to
clutter up Makefile.am with yet more commands, I just defined them
in the file as follows:

#define MEMSTAT
#define EXPORT
#define READONLYSTRINGS
