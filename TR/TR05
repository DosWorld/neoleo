TR05: Legacy Oleo

Notes on how to compile the original version of Oleo

* https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-oleo

* http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/oleo/

* gist which contains a patch for the sources:
	https://gist.github.com/blippy/f611d5e7903a2b587e6f88549fcb0567
  The gist won't work on the source tarball because some of the source files are missing. CVS can now be compiled, but I am surprised that the tarball ever worked in the first place.


* My notes on compilation problems:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-oleo/2017-03/msg00003.html
  largely reproduced below


	I have taken a look at your CVS repo, done some hacking, and I have been able to compile oleo! It runs! I do not have things in a suitable form for a patch, but here is an overview of the results of my investigations so far:

	* src/Markefile.am:8 Need to get rid of `../lib/ansi2knr'
	Googling around, this seems to way to convert ANSI C definitions to K&R (Kernighan and Ritchie "traditional C"). I'm happy to drop that, as nobody should be using such an antiquated compiler

	* doc/*texi compilation fails
	The fixes for these are pretty trivial and non-controversial.

	* libxp
	autoreconf has a problem with LT_HAVE_LIBXP. I have commented it out for now, and was able to obtain a build. However, the root cause appears to be "underquoting" in m4/xp.m4. My knowledge `m4' is practically non-existent, but I will take a look to see if I can fix whatever seems to be the problem.

	* So, in summary, it should be too difficult to get oleo working again. I'm not sure if you are aware, but there is apparently a patch for oleo here:
		https://launchpadlibrarian.net/19062178/oleo_1.99.16-11.diff.gz
	It seems to patch the tar distribution: `configuration' in particular. So although it's not exactly what we want, it's worth noting its existence.

* On Arch Linux, there seems to be a recent attempt at building oleo:
	https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/oleo/
oleo 1.99.16-3 x64 from 2017-02-18 does not build, asper my comment dated
2017-03-04


* Not sure if this is relevant: configure.in :
	AM_C_PROTOTYPES may be a problem
