TR06: Magic numbers
===========================================================================
2017-08-12

The purpose of the magic numbers is to emplace mechanisms so that
we can check that cells have been properly created and destroyed.
Currently, they are not. lists.cc mallocs space for a cell, but
it does not call new(). So it's just random memory.

The proposition is to use magic in a cell. At the constructor, set
magic = 0xOOOFF1CE to denote proper construction
magic = 0x0DEFACED to denote proper destruction
